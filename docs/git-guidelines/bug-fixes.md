# Bug/Fixes

If there are any bugs/fixes to be done on the merged “feature” branch, then it is not done directly on the develop branch. A new branch bug_fixes is created as follows:

    bug_fixes/fix_name     or  bug_fixes/bug_name

Example : bug_fixes/login_error, bug_fixes/token_expiry.

Once the fixes are done, after that, it is merged to the dev/develop branch.
